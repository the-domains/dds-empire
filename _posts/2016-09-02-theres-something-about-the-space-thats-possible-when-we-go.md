There's something about the space that's possible when we go beyond just connecting with the planet to being in communion with the planet.

Communion is when every one of your barriers is down, when there is no resistance and reaction or alignment or agreement. It is the space of total raw, no pretence, no lying, no trying.

Where chaos reigns and creation explodes in a way that rarely even dreamed of.
